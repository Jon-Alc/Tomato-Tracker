Tomato Tracker is a Discord bot written in Python that scrapes my Discord messages, and records the length of my work sessions in this Google spreadsheet:

The spreadsheet itself has metrics it tracks from my work sessions, such as accumulated time spent in minutes, time converted to pomodoros, and averages for time and pomodoros.
